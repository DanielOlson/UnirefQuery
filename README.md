# UnirefQuery

Have you ever needed to find the seed sequences for the largest clusters in uniref? Now you can find them EASY!!

Build the project, then run "UnirefQuery <file_path> <max_seq_len> <queue_size>"

UnirefQuery will then look through <file_path> to find the largest <queue_size> clusters with seed sequences smaller than <max_seq_len>.
